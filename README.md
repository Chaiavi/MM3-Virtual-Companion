Might and Magic III - Isles Of Terra Equipment Calculator

This is intended to be a basic web page which will help people playing mm3 Isles of Terra evaluate the equipment they carry.

The scenario which caused me to create this page was one which happens a lot, I play the game, get into a dungeon or just kill many baddies and get lots of loot, I then go to the nearest town to equip each character with the best equipment (weapon and\or armor) and sell all of the rest.

The above scenario is a nightmare where I need to make many calculations and comparisons between the equipment I carry and it takes too much time.

So, although I do appreciate this aspect of the game (I really do), I still think that an equipment calculator like this one might come in handy for many players (I hope you still play this amazing game).


How to use?
Just choose the equipment type and the material from which it was created and you will get the information you need.

How were the calculations made?
I used Aaron Shanon's article where he puts all of the equipment stats:

I tried to remove as many complications as I could (Advanced players will be mad at me here), so, for example if a Katana does 4-12 damage, I just took the average of 8.
Another simplification I have done here was adding the damage bonus to the hit bonus of the material, so if for example you have a gold weapon which has a hit bonus of 4, and damage bonus of 8, I have added 12 (4 + 8) to the damage score.

So a gold katana will get a damage score of 20 (8 damage average + 12 gold damage = 20).
